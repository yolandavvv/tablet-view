      <h1>What is Omakase?</h1>
      <h2>------I trust you, chef</h2>
      <p><br> Few formal dining experiences are as revered or as intimidating as omakase, a form of Japanese dining in which
        guests leave themselves in the hands of a chef and receive a meal which is seasonal, elegant, artistic and uses
        the finest ingredients available.
        omakase changes with each occasion, with the chef making decisions about what to cook mid-course. The truth of
        omakase lies in the word itself—“Omakase shimasu”, it means "I leave it up to you." Now the complete fate of
        your meal is in the hands of the chef.

      <h1>Buy The Ticket, Take The Ride</h1>
      <p><br> Omakase is for the brave and adventurous.
        <br><br>
        In his book The Story of Sushi, academic and writer Trevor Corson says, "[Omakase is] what the sophisticated
        customer says to the chef when settling down at the sushi bar. Sushi connoisseurs seldom order off a menu.
        Traditionally, sushi bars in Japan didn't even have menus."<br>
        <br>
        It's also important to trust the chef. If you come in with an open mind to explore and experience new things
        then you'll be able to experience a really good omakase meal.

      <h1>Expect To Interact With The Chef</h1>
      <p><br> Because omakase is so dependent on the happiness of the guest, it's not uncommon to find that you have the
        chef's full attention. At Sushi Taro, only six people are able to partake in the omakase counter per night and
        two chefs are committed to the meal. At Omakase Room by Tatsu, Sekiguchi is the only chef and provides three
        seatings per night for a maximum of 8 to 10 guests total.<br>
        <br>
        Dining omakase means being face-to-face with the chef, who will gauge your reaction and help guide you toward
        the best possible experience. "It's a great pleasure for anybody who cooks," Yamazaki says thoughtfully. "You
        aren't just cooking in the kitchen, you want to know the reaction of the customer."
